# SmartThings Edge Drivers

I hereby present to you, "self-made" (with fair share of looking through other available drivers), open-source Edge Drivers to be used within SmartThings ecosystem. My main goal for this repository is to store drivers of devices I'm using personally and I wasn't to able to find a driver in an official or community channels. Although, if you'd like (for some reason) to ask me for a help with your device, hit me up (probably via issues in this repo).

# Channels

Because this repo (and generally the idea of sharing drivers) is fairly new, I've created only one, [experimental](https://bestow-regional.api.smartthings.com/invite/eGM6B3qoB0MA) channel. As stated in channel's description, expect things to break or disappear and don't be surprised when you'll need to reinstall a driver.

I think that, after some time, I'll be moving drivers into a "stable" channel. But since, for now, there's only one driver, a "stable" channel is yet to be created.

# Rules

Feel free to use this drivers and code in any way you see fit, granted that you'll follow [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/pekacprowicz/smartthings-edge-drivers/blob/main/LICENSE).
Based on a fact that you're getting stuff for free, you're depriving yourself of the right to "demand" anything.
However, any ideas of improvements, bug reports or general praise is much appreciated.
